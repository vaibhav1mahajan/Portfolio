## 📌 About Me

I'm Vaibhav Mahajan, a passionate web developer based in India. I chose an unconventional path by stepping away from traditional college education to pursue hands-on learning and real-world development. Currently, I'm focused on building impactful projects, mastering modern tech stacks, and continuously growing both as a developer and a problem solver.

- 🔧 Tech Stack: React, Next.js, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Docker, TypeScript, GitHub
- 🌱 Currently learning: Flutter and Python
- 🧠 Interested in: System design, open-source, scalable web apps
- 💬 Fun fact: I'm an introvert working on becoming more outgoing 🙌
